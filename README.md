# ImageStitiching
Combines multiple overlapping images into one seamless panoramic image.

This project uses the bundle adjustment to refine the extrinisic and intrinisic parameters 
of the camera. 

The bundle adjustment was done from scratch to understand the process. 
It also features dlt and ransac too done from scratch. 

The resulting file is huge, see the result folder.

Unfinished, changing some calibrations
